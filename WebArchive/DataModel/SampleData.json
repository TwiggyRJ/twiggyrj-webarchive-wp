The recipe will be applied to several illustrative problems in the study of random walk and random aggregation. In particular, a derandomized version of the internal diffusion-limited aggregation model in two dimensions gives rise to a growing blob that is remarkably close to circular and also displays intriguing internal structures.

(The fact that they have only managed to resurrect three zombies to date has not discouraged them.) An intrepid airline pilot living near the cemetery must rescue his wife from this low-budget terror. Can you prove it *didn't* happen?",

The recipe will be applied to several illustrative problems in the study of random walk and random aggregation. In particular, a derandomized version of the internal diffusion-limited aggregation model in two dimensions gives rise to a growing blob that is remarkably close to circular and also displays intriguing internal structures. This is joint work with Ander Holroyd and Lionel Levine.",
